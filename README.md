# Wallet-less Crypto + Traditional Payment System

A next-generation payment platform that combines crypto and fiat payments into one seamless experience — no wallet setup required.
Our goal is to make paying with crypto, credit/debit, or bank as easy and familiar as using Apple Pay or Stripe.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview

What We're Building
A streamlined checkout flow that allows users to:
- Pay using cryptocurrency, credit/debit cards, or bank accounts
- Skip the wallet setup — payments can be completed via email or social login
- Enable merchants to receive instant fiat settlements
- Deliver an experience that feels like Apple Pay meets Stripe, but powered by blockchain transparency

------------------------------------------------------------

## Core MVP Features

### Merchant Dashboard
- Transaction history by payment type and status
